	<h2>What is period poverty?</h2>
		<p>
    Globally, many people in low-income communities suffer from the lack of resources. People tend to forget that anyone who menstruates experiences this struggle even further because of their inaccessibility to sanitary products to maintain their personal hygiene. This issue is referred to as Period Poverty and it requires additional recognition because this is a necessity for all menstruators. If you think about it, sanitary products are expensive and low on the list of things to get for someone who is struggling to get food on the table. Menstruators who are experiencing period poverty have a greater risk of having health issues because of their insanitary substitutions for products in times of need. </p>
<br>
 <p>
   Not only does this affect them healthwise, but also in their daily routines. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Policy Lab wrote, “According to a 2014 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 1 out of every 10 menstruating youth misses school during their menstrual cycle due to lack of access to menstrual products and resources.” Education is already limited enough for minors in low-income communities, so being able to help them have access to sanitary products can allow them to avoid missing valuable knowledge. “Whether it’s writing to representatives, advocating for free products in our schools, spreading period positivity on social media, or hosting donation drives for menstruators in need, every action has a ripple effect.” (School of Public Health, University of Michigan). Any amount or thing that you can donate helps!

	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>
			Period poverty is a challenge we want to help overcome. On our website, we strive to inform and provide opportunities for people who are willing to help those who menstruate in low-income communities. We included volunteer and donation resources from larger and established organizations that have the same mission. We hope to create a community of individuals to help relieve these women and young girls from challenges that are caused by menstruation.
