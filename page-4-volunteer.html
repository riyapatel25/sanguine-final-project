     <h5 class="resource-title">National Diaper Bank Network</h5>
			<p> Over half of all diaper bank programs rely entirely on volunteer activity. Diaper banks in the National Diaper Bank Network come in many different sizes – but regardless of size, they can always use a helping hand. Spending a few hours sorting, packing or wrapping diapers and other basic need items can make a huge difference for your local program and the families they serve.

<h5 class="resource-title">Helping Women Period</h5>
      <p> HWP prioritizes the needs of people experiencing relationship violence, who have been denied access to resources due to systemic racism and institutional biases, we direct support to communities of color and organizations that serve BIPOC communities. We listen to our BIPOC partners and we adjust our support based on the cultural and traditional preferences of the people we serve.

      <h5 class="resource-title">I Suppport The Girls</h5>
      <p> Volunteers are the backbone of our organization. Besides those who volunteer to conduct drives and collections, volunteers are involved in many of the behind-the-scenes aspects of I Support The Girls. Some of our volunteers are involved in research projects and some are conducting studies. We have volunteers who spend a few minutes on the phone each day, helping us gather information which we use in our fundraising, marketing and advocacy efforts. And yes, we have hundreds of volunteers yearly who take an hour or two to sort through thousands of products covering the living room floor of our affiliate heads homes! Without their help, we would not have been able to deliver and distribute over 4 million products in just four years.
